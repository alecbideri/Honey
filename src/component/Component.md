# Docs on components 

# Navbar

- The navbar consists of three main sections which are mentioned by the few : 


    * The logo section 
    * The menu section 
    * The icon section 
    * The Responsive menu icon 
    * The Responsive menu itself .
  
- Every asset that was used was retrieved from the asset folder and hold the dummy content and the 
other assets such as the images for the icons 

# Responsive Menu 

- The responsive is wrapped around the  framer animation components that allowed to integrate some animations
in the collapse and the de-collapse of the navigation menu. 
 
- Same thing the content was retrieved from the dummy object data that was provided in the assets. 


## Below are the NPM packages used 

```
npm i framer-motion
```

N.B : The Navigation was implemented to endure that the responsiveness is also met.
